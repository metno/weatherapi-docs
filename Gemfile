# Hello! This is where you manage which Jekyll version is used to run.
# When you want to use a different version, change it below, save the
# file and run `bundle install`. Run Jekyll with `bundle exec`, like so:
#
#     bundle exec jekyll serve

gem "jekyll", "~> 4.3" # installed by `gem jekyll`

gem 'liquid', '~> 4.0', '>= 4.0.4' # needed to avoid "Liquid Exception: undefined method `tainted?'"

gem "just-the-docs", "0.4.1" # pinned to the current release

# If you have any plugins, put them here!
group :jekyll_plugins do
  gem "jekyll-feed", "~> 0.6"
end
