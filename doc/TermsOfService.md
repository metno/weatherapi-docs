    What you must agree to before using api.met.no
---

This document describes the terms for using the MET Weather API.
Changes to the terms will be announced on the [mailing list](./support).

The service has good capacity and can handle relatively large volumes of
requests, but the capacity is not unlimited. We ask all users to respect
the guidelines so that the service will be stable.

Most important rules:

1. You must identify yourself
2. You must not cause unnecessary traffic
3. You must not overload our servers

## General information about the service

All weather data on the api are continually updated. New data will be made
available in the service continuously. In order to receive important
notifications about changes to the service we strongly suggest you either
subscribe to either our api-users mailing list or the RSS feed.

When new versions of products are introduced (usually after a beta period), the older
versions will be deprecated. This can be monitored by checking for a 203 status code
(instead of the usual 200); if so this should be logged and/or shown as a warning.
Deprecated versions will be terminated after a reasonable time period (usually 1 month).

There are no guarantees of delivery regarding this service, or possibilities to
obtain an SLA.

If you need to get a customized delivery of weather data and products, you can
see what is offered in ECOMET catalogue on [ecomet.eu](https://www.ecomet.eu/ecomet-catalogue).

## Legal stuff

### Trademarks and naming restrictions (NEW)

You are not allowed to make services/sites that appear to be made by Yr, NRK or
The Norwegian Meteorological Institute. In other words, you may not use the word
"Yr" as a part of your service name, or attach the Yr logo to your service.

### Identification

All requests must (if possible) include an identifying User Agent-string (UA) in the request
with the application/domain name, optionally version number.
You should also include a company email address or a link to the company website
where we can find contact information. If we cannot contact you in case of
problems, you risk being blocked without warning.

Examples of valid User-Agents:

    "acmeweathersite.com support@acmeweathersite.com"
    "AcmeWeatherApp/0.9 github.com/acmeweatherapp"

In cases where this is not possible (e.g. image links or simple cross-origin requests in Javascript), the website must instead identify itself using an `Origin` (Javascript) or `Referer` (for image links) header.

### Attribution

All open data require attribution as specified in the CC BY 4.0 license:

> You must give appropriate credit, provide a link to the license,
> and indicate if changes were made. You may do so in any reasonable manner, but
> not in any way that suggests the licensor endorses you or your use.

For more information, please see our [Licensing and Data Policy](./License).

### Personal data

As a app or site developer, the confidentiality of the users' personal
data are your own responsibility. If you call the API directly from an app or
browser, the user's IP address will be stored in our logs, along with
any possible geocoordinates used in requests. To guarantee anonymity we
recommend using a proxy gateway so that the ip addresses of the users
are not revealed to us.

All api.met.no access logs are stored in our own data center in Oslo, Norway.
Company email addresses (used in User-Agent headers) are not considered personal
information for GDPR and other privacy purposes. For more information, see
our [Privacy Policy Statement](https://www.met.no/en/About-us/privacy).

## Technical issues

### Traffic

1. Do not ask too often, and don't repeat requests until the time indicated in the `Expires` response header.
2. Cache data locally and and use the `If-Modified-Since` request header to avoid repeatedly downloading the same data. Do not use HEAD followed by GET since this doubles the server processing load if it misses the cache.
3. Don't generate unnecessary traffic, e.g. by repeated requests for data which never change (MetAlerts CAP files, images with timestamps and so on).
4. Don't schedule many requests at the same time, e.g. every hour on the dot or when the forecast model runs are finished.
    Add a random number of minutes to the time of the requests as our data are continously updated.
    Spread your traffic evenly out over time so it makes a flat curve, not a sawtooth.
5. When using requests with latitude/longitude, truncate all coordinates to max 4
    decimals. There is no need to ask for weather forecasts with nanometer precision!
    For new products, requests with 5+ decimals will return a 403 Forbidden.
6. Avoid continuous updating of mobile devices.
    Applications on mobile devices must not retrieve new data as long as the application is not in use.
    If you need push notification (e.g. for MetAlerts), don't make more than one poll every 10 mins.

#### Bandwidth

Anything over 20 requests/second per application (total, not per client)
requires special agreement. If you have a mobile app, this means the total
traffic from all installations. For websites, this means the total for all servers and/or
traffic coming directly from the browsers.
Sites exceeding this limit are likely to be throttled, possibly also blocked if we cannot contact you for optimization.

Copy animations and other large objects to your own server if you expect heavy traffic.
We have good bandwidth, but sites with heavy traffic
which links directly to our animations can use more bandwidth than we have
taken into account. It is desirable that you inform your users about the time
you retrieved the data so that they can consider whether they look at outdated
data.

#### Protocols

We only support encrypted HTTPS for security reasons. Unencrypted HTTP requests
are redirected to HTTPS, but since this is both a security risk and generates
unnecessary traffic it is not allowed over extended periods of time. If you
don't fix it after a reasonable interval we reserve the right to block such traffic.

#### Compression

All clients must support redirects and gzip compression (Accept-Encoding: gzip,
deflate) as described in RFC 2616.

#### Caching and proxy

Web servers and mobile apps should cache all API responses to avoid repeatedly asking for the
same data.

Use the information found in any cache headers, see RFC 2616. For example, use
If-Modified-Since requests if the Last-Modified header exists. Note that the
If-Modified-Since header should be identical to the previous Last-Modified, not
any random timestamp (and definitely not in the future).

#### Direct client-to-API connections

Browsers and mobile apps should not contact the API directly, but instead use a local
proxy (backend for frontend) server where you can cache data and add
identification/authentication details (this is the canonical way of doing
authentication in React since you cannot store client secrets in Javascript).

***Note: The conditions for using CORS are still under review and will be finalized later.***

Low-volume websites and mobile apps may use *simple* cross-origin Javascript requests and direct image links,
provided the sites identifies itself as described above. If you start generating a lot of traffic against the API,
you must set up a caching proxy gateway and route all traffic through this.

Non-simple javascript requests (i.e. using authentication or other custom headers) and CORS preflights
(whitelisting of your domain in the ``Access-Control-Allow-Origin` header) is explicitly not supported.

## Access control

### Throttling and traffic shaping

Clients which don't follow the terms are liable to being throttled. This means requests
will start getting a 429 HTTP status code instead of any content. Always check response `Status` headers
and limit traffic immediately if this should happen. If you don't suspect you have excessive amounts
of traffic, the problem is likely to be a breach of the TOS, usually lack of identification.

### Abuse

Deliberate breach of our TOS, as well as trying to circumvent traffic rate
limiting measures and/or impersonating traffic from other clients
will result in a permanent ban in the use of our services. This includes
fake or random strings as identification in the User-Agent header.
