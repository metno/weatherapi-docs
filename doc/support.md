## Mailing list

Please follow our mailing list to get important news updates about the service.
This is a low-traffic list, used only by MET Norway to contact users of the API.
This is this is the *only channel* on which we will communicate planned changes
outside the API itself (see the [archives](http://lists.met.no/pipermail/api-users/)
for past notifications).

Subscribe by following the instructions on [the list page](http://lists.met.no/mailman/listinfo/api-users),
or by sending an email to <api-users-request@lists.met.no> with the word "subscribe" in the subject line.
Subscription implies consent to store your email address (and optionally name) for GDPR purposes.
You can unsubscribe at any time, in which case your personal data will be deleted.

As from Nov 2020 we have outsourced the mailing list service to a third party.
The servers are located in the EU and covered by EU privacy laws. We have
secured a data processing agreement which secures that your personal data will
not be sold to third parties.

## RSS feeds

You can also get news updates via RSS feeds.

### News

News (blog) articles are listed in the [news archive](https://api.met.no/blog) and the
[News RSS feed](https://api.met.no//feed/news). These are more or less the
same as the mailing list messages, but are published later (usually after the change
has been implemented).

### Changelog

Change logs for all products are found in the [Changelog RSS feed](https://api.met.no/feed/changelog).
Here you will get a list of all the changes for each product.
These are usually non-breaking minor changes which is not announced on the mailing list.
