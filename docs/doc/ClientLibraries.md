    A list of external, third party interfaces for using api.met.no
---

Several independent developers have made third-party client libraries for
the various met.no APIs. We take no responsibility for the functionality
of these (in fact we know some of them are broken), please contact the
developers directly if you have any issues. The official MET Norway code
repo can be found at <https://github.com/metno>.

Also note that the use of the YR brand is not allowed in third party software
as per the Terms of Use.
